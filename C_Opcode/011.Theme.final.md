- final
  - final Class
  - final Field
  - final Method

Maybe we should first reconsider the term “variable”. In most contexts, the term “variable” includes local variables, static and non-static fields and more than often even array elements (e.g., in the memory model). Since array elements do not support being final, the answer can only be given for fields and local variables.

## 1. final in Source File

We will cover following topics in detail.

- 1) final variable
- 2) final method
- 3) final class

### 1.1. final variable

`final` variables are nothing but constants. We cannot change the value of a final variable once it is initialized. Lets have a look at the below code:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    final int MAX_VALUE = 99;

    void test() {
        MAX_VALUE = 100;
    }

}
```

```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
```

Output:

```txt
HelloWorld.java:5: error: cannot assign a value to final variable MAX_VALUE
        MAX_VALUE = 100;
        ^
1 error
```

We got a compilation error in the above program because we tried to change the value of a final variable “MAX_VALUE”.

**Note**: It is considered as a good practice to have **constant names** in **UPPER CASE(CAPS)**.

#### 1.1.1. Blank final variable

A final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as **blank final variable**. We must initialize the blank final variable in constructor of the class otherwise it will throw a compilation error (Error: variable `MAX_VALUE` might not have been initialized).

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    //Blank final variable
    final int MAX_VALUE;

    public HelloWorld() {
        //It must be initialized in constructor
        MAX_VALUE = 100;
    }

}
```

#### 1.1.2. Uninitialized static final variable

A static final variable that is not initialized during declaration can only be initialized in **static block**.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    //static blank final variable
    static final int MAX_VALUE;

    static {
        MAX_VALUE = 100;
    }

}
```

### 1.2. final method

A final method cannot be overridden. Which means even though a sub class can call the final method of parent class without any issues but it cannot override it.

```java
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String args[]){
        ABC obj= new ABC();
        obj.demo();
    }

}

class XYZ{
    final void demo(){
        System.out.println("XYZ Class Method");
    }
}

class ABC extends XYZ{

}
```

错误：

```java
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String args[]){
        ABC obj= new ABC();
        obj.demo();
    }

}

class XYZ{
    final void demo(){
        System.out.println("XYZ Class Method");
    }
}

class ABC extends XYZ{
    // demo() in ABC cannot override demo() in XYZ
    // overridden method is final
    final void demo(){
        System.out.println("ABC Class Method");
    }
}
```

### 1.3. final class

We cannot extend a final class.

```java
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String args[]){
        ABC obj= new ABC();
        obj.demo();
    }

}

final class XYZ{
    final void demo(){
        System.out.println("XYZ Class Method");
    }
}

class ABC extends XYZ{ // cannot inherit from final XYZ

}
```

Points to Remember:

- (1) We cannot change the value of **a final variable**.
- (2) **A final method** cannot be overridden.
- (3) **A final class** not be inherited.

More Details

- We cannot change the value of a final variable.
  - If method parameters are declared final then the value of these parameters cannot be changed.
  - **Local final variable** must be initializing during declaration.
  - All variables declared in an interface are by default final.
  - It is a good practice to name final variable in all CAPS.
- A final method cannot be overridden.
  - A **constructor** cannot be declared as final.
- A final class not be inherited.
- `final`, `finally` and `finalize` are three different terms. `finally` is used in exception handling and `finalize` is a method that is called by JVM during **garbage collection**.

```java
/**
 * A final variable that is not initialized at <b>the time of declaration</b>
 * is known as <b>blank final variable</b>.
 */
@Deprecated
public final class HelloWorld {

    public static final int STATIC_FINAL_INT_CST = 256;
    public static final int STATIC_FINAL_INT_BLANK;

    public static final String STATIC_FINAL_STR_CST = "Hello World";
    public static final String STATIC_FINAL_STR_OBJ = new String("Hello World");


    public final int FINAL_INT_CST = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    public final int FINAL_INT_BLANK;
    public final String FINAL_STR_CST = "Hello World";
    public final String FINAL_STR_OBJ = new String("Hello World");

    static {
        STATIC_FINAL_INT_BLANK = 512;
    }

    public /*final*/ HelloWorld() {
        FINAL_INT_BLANK = 100;
    }

    public final void testSimple(final int a, final String b, final Object c) {
        final int d = 10;
    }

}
```

## 2. ClassFile

Maybe we should first reconsider the term “variable”. In most contexts, the term “variable” includes **local variables**, `static` and `non-static` fields and more than often even **array elements** (e.g., in the memory model). Since array elements do not support being final, the answer can only be given for **fields** and **local variables**.

For **fields**, there is the `ACC_FINAL` flag, which tells whether the field is `final` or not. It has different consequences. `static final` fields can only be written in the class initializer whereas `final` instance fields are not only writable in the constructor but also via Reflection with access override. A JVM trying to take a benefit from the final nature of an instance field when optimizing, has to take care to detect reflective modifications.

For **local variables**, there is no `final` flag, in fact, there is not even a formal declaration at all. In the Java byte code, **local variables** are only indices within the **stack frame**, reused at will without premonition. So **a write to a local variable index** could be either, **a change of the variable** or **a reuse of the same index for a new variable**, e.g. `{ int x=4; }` `{ int y=5; }` may get compiled to the same byte code as `{ int x=4; x=5; }`.

```java
public final class HelloWorld {

    public void testSimple() {
        {
            int x = 4;
        }
        {
            int y = 5;
        }
    }

}
```

Output:

```txt
=== === ===  === === ===  === === ===
0000: iconst_4             // 07
0001: istore_1             // 3c
0002: iconst_5             // 08
0003: istore_1             // 3c
0004: return               // b1

LocalVariableTable:
index  start_pc  length  name_and_type
    0         0       5  this:Llsieun/sample/HelloWorld;
```

```java
public final class HelloWorld {

    public void testSimple() {
        {
            int x = 4;
            x = 5;
        }
    }

}
```

Output:

```txt
=== === ===  === === ===  === === ===
0000: iconst_4             // 07
0001: istore_1             // 3c
0002: iconst_5             // 08
0003: istore_1             // 3c
0004: return               // b1

LocalVariableTable:
index  start_pc  length  name_and_type
    0         0       5  this:Llsieun/sample/HelloWorld;
    1         2       2  x:I
```

You may easily verify this by compiling **a source file** with a `final` local variable and without `final` - the result classes will be identical.

However, Java 8 added `MethodParameters` attribute that records information about **names** and **access flags** of **method arguments**. This means, you can check whether a method argument is `final` or not.
